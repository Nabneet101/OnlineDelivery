# OnlineDelivery

In this contemporary world online delivery system is a necessity and also due 
to covid-19 it has become very important. To design such algorithm that not 
only delivers items in its shortest path from the hub to each delivery location 
but also keeping in mind with other constraints. Online Delivery Companies 
have heavy constraint on shortest path as they have to stop on every Location 
on their list keeping in mind that they need to do it the shortest path. 
For example - When a truck delivers a package to your home, in general the 
truck did not drive all the way from some distribution point to your home. 
Instead, they stopped at multiple other homes along the way and delivered 
packages to those other homes also. What the delivery companies are trying to 
do is to deliver a LOT of packages to a LOT of homes and businesses as 
efficiently as possible. 
The significance and purpose of this work is to provide an efficient way in 
which every delivery company can find the efficient route from their starting 
hub to the final destination. It is reliable to reduce excess time to deliver each 
item to its final destination. The designed algorithm saves time and require less 
human energy to operate.
